KLIFF -- KIM-based Learning-Integrated Fitting Framework
========================================================

KLIFF is an interatomic potential fitting package that can be used to fit both
physics-motivated potentials (e.g. the Stillinger-Weber potential) and machine learning
potentials (e.g. neural network potential).
The trained potential can be deployed with the KIM-API_, which is supported by major
simulation codes such as LAMMPS_, ASE_, DL_POLY_, and GULP_ among others.
